## Recap
- Merrick took the journals with her -- to cryptic
- Met up with Dorian, queen isn't happy with what's going on with the queendom. Helped Queenshenge put together some evidence to show the queen that the Bloodcoven is involved to lessen scrutiny into our activities
- Quest: Queenshenge needs help to apprehend Jorren Lam, weapons smuggler. Somewhere near Lake Brumia in the Weisar Woods. 8000g to bring Jorren back alive.
	- Anything else the smuggler has that we find is ours
	- Camped in Weisar Woods, taking out scouts
	- Oathkeeper Biggun form, arrows fired, Oathkeeper & Balerion tumbled to the ground
	- An explosive arrow fired at the ground near us with a small fuse burning. To be continued...

## Combat
- The arrow explodes into a smoke bomb, and our assailant starts to run away from us but we catch him and knock him out. He said there were 18 scouts
- We question the female scout from the lake who is with a bunch of orphans also in the smuggler scouts, that are supposed to blow into a foot-long horn when they see enemies approaching.
- We let the female scout go along with the rest of the group who are also orphans. Senik & Balerion keep watch on them while the rest proceed to the lake.
- We grapple & take the horn from another female scout, higher ranking clothing/armor. Two scouts hit us with arrows from the trees and combat initiates.
- We kill all the scouts except one which we leave unconscious.

## Fisherwoman
- Noises from north as we're debating what to do next after short rest
- Dwarven woman named Rin, strawberry blonde braids, in fishing attire with gear and fishing in a stone structure on the edge of the lake.
	- Says there's a evil red version of Sarfir running around
	- Will tell us more if we buy some of her fishing returns
		- Bucket of Eldrian Bass
		- Bucket of Westrun Trout
		- Pair of boots
		- Old dagger
		- Nice lacquered pole with a silver spear tip (interesting as it's not rusty)
		- Broken hilt with a bit of blade sticking out of it
		- Clothing
		- Odds & ends
	- Says that the smugglers bother her to work with them but she wants to stay a fisherman
	- Says the smuggler den may be further north

## Smuggler's Den
- We come upon a cliff wall where a lot of boot tracks are coming to and from the wall
- We pass through the illusory wall and are in the smuggler's den
	- Desk in the back corner, spilled ink, blank parchment
	- A sense of hasty retreat by the smugglers
	- A crate with 2 Sliger company guard outfits
		- A note in one of the outfits: "Don't forget, sweet rose smell of the plum"
		- A tome -- a shipping ledger
	- Manacles & smell of urine -- possible human trafficking?
	- Boot prints & drag marks. What was dragged may be a large geometric object based on the marks.

## Following the drag marks
- Back southwards along the east side of Lake Brumia
- Across the Moggen River
- Through part of the Daggerpine Forest
- Onto the Queensroad where the tracks start to blend with all the other foot traffic
- The tracks were last headed North towards Ganmion
	- 2-4 horses, maybe 10 people, 1 or more carts??
	- Guards on the Queensroad haven't seen anything that stood out
