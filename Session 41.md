- Current events:
	- We got the shipping receipt from Captain Taylor; the shipment with the wardrobe is heading to Aavernal. The receipt notes the shipment from Haan -> through Shorescale Forest -> Northen -> Aavernal, by foot
		- Aavernal trade policy stipulates foot trade only; no skyships
		- Shipment from Haan is leaving on the 22nd; today is the 19th.
	- Investigate haunted monastery in Shorescale Forest
	- Lizardfolk aggression to the east (Hunter's Islands) more far off
	- Undead activity on Hunter's Islands
	- Kobolds attacking locals to the south Faenra Bluffs
		- Apparently dragons are only up to the North but the book I read was a conspiracy-type book
- Before we leave with the shipment, we decided to find some info about Red Sarfir
	- Wayward youth of Haan know about Red Evil Sarfir's activities and why he's wanted
		- We can investigate in Haan at Wyrmsguard, Lady's Hammer, skyport, Haan Market, City Hall, Guild Hall
	- At the Guild Hall:
		- Our quests are still there
			- Delivering a letter (Oathkeeper) to the Gullen Ruins - 500g
			- Fetch one's dog from Ganmion back to Haan (Severn) - 500g
		- 12 adventurers in the Hall
			- Balerion distracts the pretty half-elf woman companion of a weak-willed looking wizard, Quelix. The rough-looking man (Dugg) she's talking to tells Balerion to stop flirting and they start an argument.
			- We task Quelix off to the side to gather info on Red Sarfir for 30g
		- **Another rogueish woman in the corner, we paid her 75g for info about how to get rid of Netherbloom to get into Shorescale Forest. She says a younger woman named Jessie may know. Will be playing cards tomorrow night at The Stern Mama**
	- At the Haan Market:
		- Oathkeeper & Sarfir gather info that Red Sarfir is hanging out with wayward youths in the Shorescale Forest. The vendor at the fish stall hands Oathkeeper a nice salted fish as a downpayment for bringing Red Sarfir to justice.
- Back at The Three Sisters:
	- We recollect what we've learned: Red Sarfir with youths in the Shorescale Forest
	- Quelix returns with more info: the Netherbloom can be shaped by Lizardfolk song and is sensitive to sound
	- We may be able to gather more info from Jessie who's playing cards tomorrow night at the Stern Mama
	- Oathkeeper scouted the forest as a gyrfalcon and saw that Netherbloom was indeed spreading in the Shorescale Forest
- Next night, at The Stern Mama:
	- 100g entry to Orlop (name for the very bottom of a ship) which is where Jessie is playing cards. Casino type of place but with lots of influential people inside
	- We paid 600g advance fee + 3 people's entry fees (Oathkeeper, Sarfir, Samira)
	- 10g buy-in Royals -- kind of like blackjack. We play some rounds and find where Jessie is
	- We find Jessie waiting for her next opponent at a table - younger woman, short dirty blonde hair, puffy blouse under a leather vest - pirate royalty
		- Quivering Bow - gnomish game. Each person rolls 1d10, roll between to take the pot
		- Jessie will give us the info for a favor: her frenemy Red Rose took a weapon from Jessie. Small dagger with symbol of merfolk people; likely rusted; refinished; on Red Rose's ship, which is in Haan
		- As a deposit on the promise of a favor owed, Jessie tells us that Netherbloom comes from the elemental plane of water
