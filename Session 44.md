## Recap
- Lost games of Quivering Bow against Jessie at the Orlop, with some info being the wager.
	- The info: how to get past the Netherbloom vines guarding the haunted monastery in the Shorescale Forest. Red Sarfir is rumored to be holed up here with some deliquent youths
- She offered to give us the info if we stole an heirloom dagger from a ship docked at Haan, Red Rose's ship, the Everrun
- Three elves canvassed on deck
- The plan:
	- Severn will perform an impromptu inspection of the ship while Oathkeeper & Lihra drop onto the ship to find the dagger

## The Night Before
- Samira performs well for once on stage at the Orlop, but the party is not there to witness it

## The Everrun
- Severn, Samira, Sarfir (disguised), Balerion pretend to inspect the ship for rats
- Sarfir, Samira, Balerion head below deck
- Oathkeeper as Biggun drops Lihra onto a lower deck at the back of the ship, where she hangs from a window until she gets the attention of Samira who lets her in. Lihra is invisible
- Lowest deck contains nothing but a magical door marked with Thieve's Cant with some Conjuration magic. 
- Speak to Plants tells Oathkeeper to "help them"
- Oathkeeper uses an immovable rod to lock the way to the lower deck, and we enter the magical door.
	- Behind it, fine white sand, gold coins, small gems.
	- A long hallway with low torchlight, 4 doors: hot, cold, no knob and astral vastness within (seen through keyhole), and normal
	- The voice propels us farther down the hallway though, and there are 2 more doors, open inwards, with white light coming out of both. Both have specters causing a mess within them
	- We try to sneak past the specters but they hear us and attack, we retaliate and kill them in return. They disappear into sand and gems
	- At the end of the hallway, a pair of double doors that are locked. To the left, sinister laughter. To the right, Spree & Sprig, petrified in stone with an open maroon tome on the floor in front of them.
