- **RECAP**: Severn is trying to delay the elves on the deck of the Everrun while the rest of the Natural Ones try to find the dagger (and enter a pocket dimension)

- Severn successfully delays elves and guards up top by lying. Also, he can't read
- In the pocket dimension on the bottom deck, past the spectres:
	- Oathkeeper down the right side of the hallway
	- Samira & Lyra at the door in the middle
	- Sarfir & Balerion down the left side of the hallway
