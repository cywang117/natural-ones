- Artemis explains some history to us:
	- Gull was falling apart around 300 years ago, they were messing with magic they weren't supposed to
	- The Winterglow Accords: Lumina, Alador (youngest bro), Alric (middle bro)
		- "No nation may use hexstone for the creation of military vehicles or arms"
		- An agreement between Zavarre, Ganmion, and Cistra
	- Up until that point of tension, Lede had been trying to sow discord
		- Lede was trying to push into the main citadel of Cistra, and as a result, the entire citadel was spirited away somewhere (nobody knows)
- Looted things from Cistran vault:
	- Captain Fae - 3 sealed books
	- Balerion - 3 sealed books & 3 sealed scrolls
	- Samira - 2 sealed books
	- Books closed with Arcane Lock
- The altar wth the 4 stone slots, 4 hexstones, a lever, and 2 mirror portals: black & silver portals
	- Black portal: prison area Onyx 3 (according to Artemis, we don't want to go there)
	- Silver portal: researcher portal back to Cistra
- COMBAT: Slaads / other smaller fiends charge through the door to the vault
- We pull out the red hexstone from Artemis the rabbit construct's chassis and activate the silver portal. The mirror wobbles as we activate it
- Oathkeeper & Balerion stay behind. Samira, Senik, Sarfir, Aisling go through the portal into a stuffy room with low, dim blue light
- The rabbit Artemis requests we seal the Cistran chamber after learning of the fate of Cistra.
	- Silver mirror: researchers
	- Onyx mirror: Onyx 3 prison. Skeletal remains of prisoners and missing hexstone. A foul being that temporarily turned us against each other. A skeletal juggernaut fight
