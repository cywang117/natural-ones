## Recap
Escorting ship to Haan, stowaway Ramona Vigil casting ritual on a Cistran wardrobe. Ramona seemed to have been outcasted by Bloodcoven and is seeking revenge, and may be working with us? A cultist activated the wardrobe and summoned a bunch of demons which Shigguroth & party threw overboard. Ramona wishes to speak with the party...

## After Ship Battle
Bodies of demons waste away, bodies of cultists remain. Ship damage. 

We confront Ramona and follow her, keeping an eye on her as she finishes the wardrobe ritual. She seems to have destroyed the enchantment in the wardrobe, and turns to us. 

Ramona gives us instructions on a spell to dispel Cistran based magic, given 10 minutes for a ritual. (This isn't a combat spell, it's a story-only spell).

Chat with Ramona while ship is being repaired.

Ramona AMA:
- *Q:* Tell us all about the 5 artifacts.
	- *A:* Ramona had the ring but it was taken away. They're desperate to find it. 
- *Q:* Why did Ramona join with the Bloodcoven?
	- *A:* She was once Cistran, young when the citadel was destroyed through some fault of empire & church. She wanted revenge, and sought to have power. She joined the force that was against the church: the Bloodcoven. She sought out Harthic as the most powerful.
- *Q:*  Others of the Bloodcoven - a list of names?
	- *A:* Harthic Stormbrow, Brell, the dragonborn & the Elf (Velaryn and Treduke Stormscale). No one else of note.
- *Q:* What to do when all 5 artifacts?
	- *A:* Some ritual using their relics to summon Daz'zak?

Sliger kept the relic (the helmet) the whole time and didn't know the whole time, but as soon as Harthic found out, he killed Sliger immediately.

The Bloodcoven that are to be granted power by Daz'zak call themselves Candidates. They go around collecting the relics. 

Some alchemist out west by Fort Hadoko. Forces on the coast have been corrupted to serve Harthic (?) thinking that Daz'zak will end his suffering.

There is no pattern between who wields the artifact and who has the most power/faith. The ones with the most power/faith are called the Candidates.

Ramona will trade us the location of Bloodcoven HQ in return for us to ask the Queensguard if they will ship her off to Velgrad after all this. We agree to asl, but no guarantees.

Loot the cultists: nothing.
