- Morning of 25th Ignir
- We wake up refreshed and press onwards. 
	- Investigation -- Ulduvaran camp. 
	- Rotting pieces of fruit, Tanlen's survival senses tell us that the rotting fruit probably don't belong to the hobgoblins
	- 100ft out down the path, some fallen logs that look like they've been placed. A hole hidden under one of the logs, a chest 2ft x 1ft in the hole. Finished oak bound by iron. Inscription: *"Property of HK"*. Contents:
		- 400g
		- Small bag of gems, worth 150g total
		- Vial of yellow liquid moving on its own with a tint of black (Identify: Potion of Speed)
- West: narrow mountain pass
- North: steep hill path with switchbacks
	- Small coniferous grove at top of hill.
	- Northward from hill: evergreen bushes, small clearing in center of grove northward.
	- Clearing: people with the Lu'hai guild markings - researchers
		- Hejj the female tabaxi, Geldman the male dwarf, 2 gnomes Hedlen (F) & Rodney (M)
		- They saw the hobgoblins marching west a couple days ago
- The Lu'hai researchers are here researching some ruins northward at a cliff face, with a giant chunk of it blasted out. They're stuck at a large arched stone door -- Gullen or Cistran in origin perhaps. The Cistran amulet opens the door. Enter into a chamber. In the center, a large black flat slate chest with glowing bands on it. Loot from this "Cistran cache":
	- 100p, 900g
	- Highly polished two-handed axe, head very round, runic inlays (+1 Greataxe Cistran style)
	- Large wand - made out of 3 wand shafts braided around one another. Flourished tip (Wand of magic missile)
	- Large refined hexstone
	- Shirt of interlnked chain with runes on collar and pauldrons (+1 chainmail)
	- Curved dagger with heavy handle and runic inscriptions upon the blade, tied to a very sturdy rope (+1 rope dart)
- Northeast: manicured dirt path
	- Noble house may have manicured the path. May be near the Herald's Nest Forest. Smell of a large beast nearby (excrement, musk)
	- Fight with giant boars and harpies
- Up the path further, a temple after some trekking. This is Tanlen's trial. A plaque which Tanlen touches and the chamber locks behind us and starts shaking.
